    <h2 id="whatHead">What is an informed vote?</h2><br>
    <p id="what">An informed vote is one that is based on facts about each candidate. An informed voter knows both sides and uses facts to pick who they will vote for. No matter who someone votes for, they can be an informed voter by making sure that their candidate aligns with their own stances and what they think is best for the country.</p>

    <div class="point2">
    <h2 id="whoHead">Who needs to be informed?</h2><br>
    <p id = "who">Everyone eligible to vote should vote! Voting is our way to have a say in our government. With that said, you can make the most of this right by making sure that you are informed what the stances of each candidate are apart from ads or media.</p>

    <!-- makes my third box/information -->
    <p class="whyImg"></p>
    <div class="point3">
    <h2 id="whyHead">Why should I care?</h2><br>
    <p id="why">You are very lucky if you are allowed to vote. Many people who live in this country under its rules cannot. You should take this right very seriously then since not everyone has this opportunity. You can show respect for other voters and fellow people who live in your country by making sure that your vote is one that is an informed one.</p>
